# Surrogator
Discover open access surrogates of paywalled scientific papers

Surrogator is a tool to automatically identify open access surrogates for research papers. 
We call a collection of research papers written by the same author(s) (or research group) as surrogates for each other if they are very closely related in content.
 
EXAMPLES: 
A conference paper and its extension published in a journal could be treated as surrogates. 

In the following, [1A] and [1B] form an example of surrogates:
[1A] Maity, Mukulika, Bhaskaran Raman, and Mythili Vutukuru. "Tcp download performance in dense wifi scenarios." Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS), 2015 7th International Conference on. IEEE, 2015.
[1B] Maity, Mukulika, Bhaskaran Raman, and Mythili Vutukuru. "TCP Download Performance in Dense WiFi Scenarios: Analysis and Solution." IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing 16.1 (2017): 213-227.

Similarly a technical report could be a surrogate for a conference publication.

UTILITY:
If the reader has access to one of the papers, he has a fair idea of the other paper, too. This is extremely useful if one of the papers is open access and the other is behind a paywall. We, at the National Digital Library of India, are using this aspect to increase the reach of your research.
